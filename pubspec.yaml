  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - C:/FridgeMateProject/FridgeMate/assets/Fridgephoto.png
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Unbound
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Unbounded-VariableFont_wght.ttf
    - family: Script
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/MarckScript-Regular.ttf
  #
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
